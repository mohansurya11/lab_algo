    The process starts with initializing ‘h’ with the most specific hypothesis, generally, it is the first positive example in the data set.
    We check for each positive example. If the example is negative, we will move on to the next example but if it is a positive example we will consider it for the next step.
    We will check if each attribute in the example is equal to the hypothesis value.
    If the value matches, then no changes are made.
    If the value does not match, the value is changed to ‘?’.
    We do this until we reach the last positive example in the data set.
